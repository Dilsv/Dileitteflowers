## Introduction

This website was designed to give access to people who want the experience of bespoke botanics without having to go out of their way to make a day special for their loved ones.

Although there are a wide variety of businesses that offer the same service, this website was built to not only offer people personalisation of flowers, but also offering pre-made designs to make their journey a little easier when making that special day more memorable.

This website could also have further commercial applications given there is a large market for botanics and smaller complimentary gifts.

This is the first of four Milestone Projects that the developer must complete during their Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. 

The main requirements were to make a responsive and static website with a minimum of three pages using primarily **HTML5** and **CSS3**.

#### The ideal user of this website is:
- Couples
- Events planners
- Businesses and offices
- Those with a general interest in plants and botanics

### User Stories
#### Someone with an interest for flowers:
1. As someone with an interest for flowers, I want to easily navigate through the website to find the relevant content.
3. As someone with an interest for flowers, I want to offer a vast choice of bouquets.
4. As someone with an interest for flowers, I want to be able to view options and arrangements for the occasion.

2. As a friend or parent of someone with an interest for botanics, I want to learn how to maintain flowers for a longer period before the wilting process.
3. As a friend or parent of someone with an interest for botanics, I want to learn what product's go well together for complimentary purposes

### Development Planes

In order to create a comprehensive and informative website, the developer researched what similar websites included, asked people with experience in botanics what would be helpful and looked into personal experience. 

#### Strategy
Broken into three categories, the website will focus on the following target audiences:
- **Roles:**
     - People currently regularly involved with flowers
     - People with experience in floristry
     - People wanting to learn more about flowers

- **Demographic:**
     - 14 - 85 year olds
     - Primarily anthophiles (not exclusively)

- **Psychographics:**
     - Personality & Attitudes:
          - Detailed and orientated
          - Expressive and thoughtful
     - Values:
          - Celebrating milestones 
          - Supporting local businesses
     - Lifestyles:
          - Wellness and self-care advocates
          - Interested in detail and aesthetic

The website needs to enable the **user** to:
- Obtain desired information
- Gain insight on the different asortments
- Contact website host
- Find them on their preferred social media platform
- Provide an easily navigable website for users to find relevant information/products

The website needs to enable the **host** to:
- Develop an online presence 
- Reach the target demographic 
- Provide channel of communication for specific products and product providers


#### Scope
A scope was defined in order to clearly identify what needed to be done in order to align features with the strategy previously defined. This was broken into two categories:
- **Content Requirements**
     - The user will be looking for:
          - Flower care information
          - Product information
          - Supporting imagery/videos
          - Contact details
          - Social Links
- **Functionality Requirements**
     - The user will be able to:
          - Easily navigate through the site in order to find the information/product they want
          - Be able to find links to external sites in order to:
               - Explore other options
               - Be able to look at supporting content
               - Contact the website host via their chosen channel of communication

#### Structure
The information architecture was organized in a **hierarchial tree structure** in order to ensure that users could navigate through the site with ease and efficiency, with the following results: 

![Site Map](assets/readme-files/tree-structure.png)

#### Skeleton 
Wireframe mockups were created in a [Figma Workspace](https://www.figma.com/file/pRD2Oi1aSuYxhFacqOmUfT/Kryan-Live?node-id=0%3A1) with providing a positive user experience in mind:

Home Page:
![Home Page Wireframe](assets/readme-files/wireframe-home.png "Home Page Wireframe")

Bio Page:
![Protective Styles Page Wireframe](assets/readme-files/wireframe-style.png "Protective Styles Page Wireframe")

Live Page:
![Regimen Page Wireframe](assets/readme-files/wireframe-regimen.png "Regimen Page Wireframe")

Press Kit Page:
![Contact Us Page Wireframe](assets/readme-files/wireframe-contact.png "Contact Us Page Wireframe")

### Design

#### Colour Scheme
The main colours used throughout the website are Eerie Black, Beaver with accents of Bone and Seasalt. 

These chosen colours were because they are typically found in nature, and are complementary to the natural colours of flowers and plants. They also provoke feelings of self-care and serenity.  

#### Typography
The pairing of the fonts [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto "Link to Roboto Google Font") and [Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald "Link to Oswald Google Font") is used throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case of import failure. 

For features that needed to be highlighted, such as the logo text and subheadings, the font [Codystar](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Codystar "Link to Codystar Google Font") and [Petit Formal Script](http://fots.google.come/specimen/ "Link to Petit Formal Script Google Font") was used, with Sans Serif as the fallback.

#### Imagery
The selected imagery is modern and cohesively aesthetic, reflecting the style and feel of the website. It is also supporting of any informative text presented. 

The imagery is catching and visually represents the theme of the website.

All imagery provides alternative text to be used in the event that the element cannot be rendered.

## Features

### Design Features
Each page of the website features a consistent responsive navigational system:
- The **Header** contains a conventionally placed **logo** in the top center of the page (whereby by clicking this will redirect users back to the home page) and **navigation bar** in the top center of the page.
- The **Footer** contains the appropriate **social media icons**, linking users to the appropriate social media site. On smaller screens the Footer decreases in size relative to the other elements on the page.
- On smaller screens, the navigation bar shrinks in size and remains in the center of the webpage.


<dl>
  <dt><a href="index.html" target="_blank" alt="Discover3c Home Page">Home Page</a></dt>
  <dd>The Home Page consists of a hero image and and about us section:
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Hero Image</strong> - Occupying 80% of the page width, while viewing on a desktop. On mobile devices the image changes to fit the screen better, while occupying 100% of the page width. The imagery used was specifically chosen as it created a impactful first impression, setting the tone of the website for the user.
          </li>
          <li><strong>About Us text and imagegy</strong> - The text occupies 60% of the page width while textwrapping around the image. The what is 3c hair section has an image occupying 40% of the page width while the text stays at 60%. This was to make the viewing of this information clear and easy to understand. On smaller screens, the width of the text and imagery increases to take up 90% of the page width and all image size decreases retrospectively.  
          </li>
     </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="protective.html" target="_blank" alt="Protective Styles Page">Protective Styles Page</a></dt>
  <dd>The Protective Styles page was made with clear informative text and imagery in mind:
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Imagegry</strong> - Occupying around 60% of the page width while viewing on desktop, each image was cafely selected to properly portray the style that is being talked about. These images reduce in size retrospectively when the screen size is reduced.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Text</strong> - Occupying 60% of the page width while viewing on desktop, this was to keep everything nicely aligned and to the make the information clear and appealing. The width of the text increases to 90% on small screens and reduces in size. 
          </li>
     </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="regimen.html" target="_blank" alt="Regimen Page">Regimen Page</a></dt>
  <dd>The look of this page is coherient with the other pages however the layout is slightly changed to allow for specific imagery and videos. 
     <ul> 
          <li><strong>Wash Day video</strong> - Occupying around 60% width of the page while viewing on desktop, this highers the video's importance by making it a large aspect of this page. This was an <strong>embedded link</strong> from YouTube by Milky Candles. For smaller screens the video size decreases retrospectively.  
          </li>
          <li><strong>Product Suggestion</strong> - Split into a 1 row with 4 coloumns, the product images are nicely aligned into 4 blocks while viewing on a desktop. On smaller screens this changes to 2 rows with 2 columns allowing the images to display as a block of 4. 

</ul>

  </dd>

  <dt><a href="contact.html" target="_blank" alt="Contact Us Page">Contact Us Page</a></dt>
  <dd> On the desktop, the contact us form occupies 60% width of the page. This descreases retrospectively for tablet view. On mobile device the form takes up 90% width of the page. 
  </dd>
  <dd>There is a <strong>call to action</strong> button on the page:
     <ul>
          <li>Which propts the user to fill out each section of the form, on submit the form resets.</li>
     </ul>
  </dd>
  
  </dd>
</dl>

## Issues and Bugs 
The developer ran into a number of issues during the development of the websites, with the noteworthy ones listed below, along with solutions or ideas to implement in the future.

**Navbar Bug** - An inconsistency was detected later on with the images. On the page view some images were larger than others and wasnt inline with eachother, making it less consistent. This wasn't solved as the images were different sizes by default.

**Social Links footer bug** - A bug was detected when adding the footer to the contact us page. The footer (social media icons) were inside the contact us form. This was solved by finding that there was a missing </div> that was causing the footer to be picked up in the body of the contact us form and adding </div> in the appropriate place. 

**Footer Issue on all pages** - A bug was detected when implementing the footer to be used for all pages. When looking on the ports the footer look disorientated and dimentions didn't reflect the codes in flowers.html, events.html and contact.html. [This was solved by adding a `media query` for large desktop's which would make the hero image only occupy 80% of the width of the page. On mobile view a second image that fitted nicely was implemented in order to improve the look of the home page.]

**Contact Us form bug** - A bug was detected when testing the contact us form. You were able to put in one letter on the name field and you were also able to adjust the size of the comment box. This was fixed by adding a minimum character of 5 to the input fields giving the comment section a `resize: none;`.

**Commits** - Whilst coding the developer had missed the important action of committing codes whilst building the webpage, when making small and substantial changes.
